Running a caf√© today is more than just serving good food and coffee. Customers often want to check your menu, opening hours, and even see what your place looks like before visiting. That‚Äôs why having a website has become almost a necessity ‚Äî even for a small, pet-friendly caf√© like mine.

But here‚Äôs the problem: getting a website built can cost thousands if you hire a developer or agency. For small businesses, that‚Äôs a heavy commitment, especially when you know you‚Äôll need to make updates later.

So instead of outsourcing, I decided to try something different: I built my own website using ChatGPT and GitHub.

## Why I Decided to Build It Myself

When I first thought about launching a website for Laki Caf√© & Pet Hotel, I hesitated. Spending a few thousand just to get a basic site up didn‚Äôt feel right. More importantly, I knew I‚Äôd need to make changes over time ‚Äî menus, photos, event updates. If I had to go back to a developer every time, costs would just keep adding up.

That‚Äôs when I thought: What if AI could help me do it myself?

## How AI and GitHub Helped

I used ChatGPT to generate the initial structure and code for a simple website. Even though I don‚Äôt know how to code, ChatGPT could give me clean HTML and CSS based on my instructions. Then I set it up on GitHub Pages, which allows me to host the site for free.

The process was surprisingly smooth:

1. I described the kind of website I wanted (simple, clean, with sections for caf√© info, services, and contact).  
2. ChatGPT generated the code templates for me.  
3. I uploaded the files to GitHub and published them instantly.  
4. Now, whenever I want to update text, change images, or add content, I can just edit the files myself.

## Cost Difference: Outsourcing vs DIY with AI

**Hiring a developer:** A few thousand ringgit upfront, plus ongoing costs for updates.  

**Doing it myself with AI:** Almost zero cost, except for the time I put in. Hosting via GitHub Pages is free, and ChatGPT helps me handle changes quickly.  

The savings are huge ‚Äî but even more valuable is the independence. I can control my site anytime, without waiting for someone else‚Äôs schedule.

## What I Learned Along the Way

- **AI makes things less intimidating.** Even as someone with no coding background, I could produce a working website.  
- **Flexibility is priceless.** I can update photos, text, or promotions whenever I need.  
- **Curiosity pays off.** Exploring AI tools doesn‚Äôt just save money; it also opens doors for creativity in business.

## Final Thoughts

Creating this website wasn‚Äôt just about saving money. It was about learning how AI can empower small business owners like me. From menu design to website building, AI tools are becoming practical, everyday helpers.

I‚Äôm glad I took the leap. And this is only the beginning ‚Äî as AI keeps improving, I‚Äôm excited to see how much more it can simplify running a caf√©.
